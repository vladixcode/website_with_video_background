# Landing page with video background (HTML & CSS & JS)

This is a simple website (Landing page) with solely goal of creating a nice Video background. That's something we all have seen here and there and I have decided to finally create something like that as isolated small project.

The focus is on simple & clean design, but what really stands out is the video background with overlay that gives a little "bright blue" effect. Some nice text (nice headings actually, text is just lorem ipsum), some social media icons with some effects on buttons and icons with a little help of embedded JavaScript. And we have a menu button, if we click it opens/close a menu.

This is a good boilerplate for a nice looking website. Additional improvements are underway related to responsive design and Sass implementation (good candidate for that).
